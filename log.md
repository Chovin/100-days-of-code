# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: January 3rd, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Slow start. Meant to spend most of the time on the FCCG-Website but got caught up in management. Ended up just spending some time with Pico-8.

**Thoughts:** New to game dev. Going to make projects to prepare for the bootcamp in February.  
Thinking of making levels much like [@TRASEVOL_DOG](https://twitter.com/TRASEVOL_DOG)'s [one room dungeon](https://trasevol-dog.itch.io/one-room-dungeon)

Think I might do the #TrainingDungeon also.. ðŸ˜¬ #100daysofcode #GuamCoders 

That means 2 games, one a week, then 2 games, one every 3 days, then 4-5 games, one every day.. oh boy..

##### (delete me or comment me out)

**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts**: I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.

### Day 1: June 27, Monday

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts** I've recently started coding, and it's a great feeling when I finally solve an algorithm challenge after a lot of attempts and hours spent.
